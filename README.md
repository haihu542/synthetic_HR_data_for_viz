# synthetic_HR_data_for_viz
Generates synthetic HR data for a Tableau Viz

Needed some HR data for a Tableau Viz so wrote this script to generate some sythetic data.
Creates names, departments, salaries, years of service, promotions, attrition, hiring, and job titles.

At present, it does not logically mimic real world data. There are nuances missing in promotion logic or salaries dependent on age, job description and tenure.
